### Adding Maps

This repository contains the sample code I built for my June 2020 Twitch stream for HERE Technologies. It represents a simple website (not using Jamstack or anything) that has location information. In the v1 folder, you can see the initial version of this.

Todo - describe each folder and what it modifies.

Notes:

v2 implements the HERE [Map Image API](https://developer.here.com/documentation/map-image/dev_guide/topics/what-is.html) to render simple static maps.

v3 implements HERE [Maps API](https://developer.here.com/documentation/maps/3.1.17.0/dev_guide/index.html) to add a map with markers.

v4 - add the ability to click and get an overview - either overlay or info below.
